# Error Handling

This Solidity program is a simple "Error" program that demonstrates the basic assert, requier and revert functionality of solidity programming language. The purpose of this program is to demonstrate the functioning of the various error control methods in solidity and explain their functioning.
## Description

This Solidity project is a straightforward 'Error Handling' program showcasing the essential assert, require, and revert functionalities in the Solidity programming language. Its primary goal is to elucidate the operation of various error control mechanisms in Solidity while offering a foundational understanding of how they work.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., error.sol). Copy and paste the code from error.sol into the editor.

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.21" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile error.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "error" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the contribute, addMember and changeOwner functions. Click on the "error" contract in the left-hand sidebar, and then click on the functions within. Finally, click on the "transact" button to execute the function.
